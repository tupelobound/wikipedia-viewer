freeCodeCamp legacy project - Build a Wikipedia Viewer

This project originally formed part of the Intermediate Front End Development certificate, which focused heavily on interacting with APIs.

Project brief was to fulfill the following user stories:

1.  I can search Wikipedia entries in a search box and see the resulting Wikipedia entries.
2.  I can click a button to see a random Wikipedia entry.

Originally completed in Feb 2018.
